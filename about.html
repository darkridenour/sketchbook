		Darien is a current junior at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She considers herself a narrative artist because of her desire to tell stories in many of different mediums. She is an illustrator, animator, screenwriter, comics artist, podcaster, and just about everything in between, besides long form novel writer (short stories are more her thing.) Essentially, she is a jack of all trades in a world that demands a master of one.

		Coming from the midwest (rural Indiana, specifically), storytelling was an important part of growing up. From reading picture books with her grandma, to listening to late night stories about her parents’ lives, she became obsessed with consuming stories. This was also elevated with our society’s obsession with content consumption. She is interested in exploring philosophical and sociological topics in her work, finding a balance between reality and fiction. She finds it’s important to include humor in her work, and usually uses it to disguise deep/difficult topics.
